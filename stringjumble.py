Assignment:

The purpose of this challenge is to gain proficiency with 
manipulating lists.

Write and submit a Python program that accepts a string from 
the user and prints it back in three different ways:

* With all letters in reverse.
* With words in reverse order, but letters within each word in 
  the correct order.
* With all words in correct order, but letters reversed within 
  the words.

Output of your program should look like this:

Please enter a string of text (the bigger the better): There are a few techniques or tricks that you may find handy
You entered "There are a few techniques or tricks that you may find handy". Now jumble it:
ydnah dnif yam uoy taht skcirt ro seuqinhcet wef a era erehT
handy find may you that tricks or techniques few a are There
erehT era a wef seuqinhcet ro skcirt taht uoy yam dnif ydnah
"""
str1 = input("Please enter a string of text (the bigger the better): ")
print ('You entered "{0}". Now jumble it:'.format(str1))


str2 = str1[::-1]


list1 = str1.split()
list2 = list1[::-1]

str3 = " ".join(list2)

print (str2)
print(str3)

size = len(list1)
counter = 0
final = ""

while counter < size:
    str4 = list1[counter]
    str5 = str4[::-1]
    final = final + str5 + " "
    counter = counter + 1

print (final)
